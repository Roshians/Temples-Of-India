            The <b>Shree Jagannath Temple</b> is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu, in Puri in the state
            of Odisha on the eastern coast of India. The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an
            earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.

            The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are
            pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. These gave their name to the English term 'Juggernaut'. Unlike the
            stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced
            every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica. It is one of the Char Dham.

            The temple is sacred to all Hindus and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great Vaishnava saints,
            such as Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, Vallabhacharya and Ramananda were closely associated with the
            temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and Adi Shankaracharya established the Govardhana Mutt,
            which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of the
            Gaudiya Vaishnavism whose founder Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for
            many years.
