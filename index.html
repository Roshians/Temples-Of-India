            Temple derived from the Latin word 'templum'. Is a structure usually built for the purpose of, and always
            dedicated
            to, religious or spiritual activities including prayer, meditation, sacrifice and worship. The templum was a
            sacred precinct defined by a priest as the dwelling place of a god or gods and the structure
            built there was created to honor the spirits of a certain place. Early temples were constructed
            on sites which the people felt had a numinous quality to them which indicated the presence of a god, gods,
            or spirits.

            The form and function of temples is thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be
            in some sense the house of one or more deities. Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity,
            and other rituals enacted, and a special group of clergy maintain, and operate the temple. The degree to
            which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts or even
            the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy. Temples typically have a main building and a
            larger precinct, which may contain many other buildings, or may be a dome shaped structure, much like an
            igloo.
