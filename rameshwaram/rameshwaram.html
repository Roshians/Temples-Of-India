            <b> Ramanathaswamy Temple</b> is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva located on Rameswaram island
            in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is also one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It is one of the 274 Paadal Petra
            Sthalams, where the three of the most revered Nayanars (Saivite saints), Appar, Sundarar and Tirugnana Sambandar, have
            glorified the temple with their songs. The temple was expanded during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty, and its
            principal shrines sanctum were renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan of the
            Jaffna kingdom. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India. The temple is located in
            Rameswaram considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. The presiding deity, the Lingam
            of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), was established and worshiped by Rama before crossing his bridge to Lanka.

            According to the Ramayana, Rama, which is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to the god Shiva to absolve him
            of the sin committed during his war against the king Ravana in Sri Lanka. Rama wanted to have a large lingam to
            worship Shiva. He directed Hanuman, the lieutenant in his army, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. When Hanuman was
            delayed in bringing the lingam, rama built a small lingam out of the sand available in the seashore, which is believed
            to be the lingam in the sanctum.

            'Ramanathaswamy' literally means 'the Master of Rama' which refers to Lord Shiva, which the temple is all about. There
            are two 'lingam' inside the temple; 'Ramalingam' by Devi Sita built by sand and 'Viswalingam' brought by Lord Hanuman
            from Kailasha (abode of Lord Shiva) and installed by Lord Rama. Temple tanks, hall of 1000 pillars, and several other
            shrines in the temple attract millions of pilgrims every year, especially during Maha Shivratri.
